## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Basic knowledge of SQL and AWS services

## Setup AWS Environment

### 1. Create an AWS Account

If you don't already have an AWS account, create one [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).

### 2. IAM Roles and Permissions

Set up IAM roles and policies to grant the necessary permissions for accessing S3, Redshift, and other AWS services.

1. Create an IAM role with S3 read/write access.
2. Create an IAM role with Redshift full access.

### 3. Configure Services

Ensure the following services are configured:

- **Amazon S3**: Create an S3 bucket to store your data.
- **Amazon Redshift**: Create a Redshift cluster.
- **AWS Glue**: Set up AWS Glue for ETL operations.

## Data Ingestion

### 1. Collect Data

Gather pandemic-related data from various sources (APIs, CSV files, JSON files, etc.).

### 2. Store Data in S3

Upload the collected data to your S3 bucket using AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.

```bash
aws s3 cp local-data-file.csv s3://your-bucket-name/path/to/data/
